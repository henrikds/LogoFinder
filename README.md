# LogoFinder
An attempt at a program that could recognize if a logo is present in an image.

## Abstract
The task is making a program that could recognize if a logo is present in an image. The program does
this by first finding areas in the two images that are going to be compared, and then searches
through these areas for similarities.

## Introduction
Image processing and analysis are found in many of the applications used in everyday life; from
analyzing stars to adding a filter on social media. Today one can easily manipulate images with
software. The code behind the software is made of advanced algorithms, this also applies to filters of
social media. An image is a function of two variables, f (x, y). X and Y is the position, making up a
point. The value of f in every point is called intensity.

When speaking of image processing one talks about changing an image, based on the information it
contains. This does not add any information, but can give a result that changes what and how the
information is displayed. This can be useful in several cases. If one wants to improve the quality of an
image, changing it to highlight certain areas or just remove unnecessary data.
Image analysis is about getting new information based on the information in the image. Examples of
this could be calculating the temperature of a star or recognize a face in a crowd. Every time an
operation is done on an image to get information it is image analysis. It is all about understanding the
image that is processed. To do this there is often needed to run calculations on the data from the
image.

The program in this report uses both image processing and analysis. It is far from the state of the art
software, but should be able to process and analyze images to give results. It runs image processing
to derive information that is useful for further analysis. The algorithm then looks at that information
to run further calculations and analysis. Compared to modern software and programs this application
is significantly slower, contains simple errors and can at times be hard to work with due to the
limited experience of the programmer, combined with it being done over the course of a semester.
